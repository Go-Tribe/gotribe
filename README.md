### Project Description

The project adopts a front-end and back-end separation architecture, consisting of three parts: the management API, the business API, and the management backend UI. The business front-end UI can be developed according to your needs or using our templates.

The diagram above clearly illustrates the structure of the Go-Tribe project and the interactions between its components:

- **Go-Tribe** is the name of the entire system framework, which includes multiple modules, each responsible for different functions.
- **gotribe-admin Management Backend**: This is the core management module of the system, used for handling backend management tasks. For security reasons, it is usually deployed on an internal network and accessed via VPN. To simplify the deployment process, we have integrated the gotribe-admin-vue Management UI with the Management API for one-click deployment.
- **gotribe Business API**: This module is responsible for handling business logic, with a particular focus on search engine optimization (SEO) and development efficiency. It is completely decoupled from the business frontend UI and supports Kubernetes deployment and horizontal scaling to accommodate the needs of businesses of different sizes.
- **gotribe-blog Blog Theme**: Provides a pre-built blog theme as an example of a business theme, demonstrating how to quickly build specific business scenarios using the Go-Tribe framework.
- **Database**: Serves as the data storage center of the system, responsible for saving all necessary data.
- **Business Frontend UI**: Users can develop customized frontend interfaces according to their specific needs, using templates provided by Go-Tribe.

The entire system is designed with a front-end and back-end separation architecture, which not only improves the system's flexibility but also allows each component to be developed and maintained independently, thereby enhancing the system's scalability and maintainability.
